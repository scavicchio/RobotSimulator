5 Hill Climbers
	For this, just run them all 5 times, save all the data, 
	we've got to make Error Bars so save ALL the data so we can generate some StDev

Jump (max height)
	Run one hill climber for a shorter amount time where the reward function
	is an increase in HEIGHT not distance, should be a straight forward change

ALternate Environment (Mars g= 1/3)
	Just change gravity to be something way lower (or way more I guess?)
	All it says is "Alternate environment" so let's choose something as EZ as possible

Damage Scenario (one missing motor)
	Just shut off a shoulder or knee joint for one of the sides and see
	if the hill climber can figure out a solution to it
		Again, doesn't have to be a very long run

That's really it, I'd say remove OMEGA values from the hilll climber and random search,
	even a small Omega value can really fuck up a lot of things if it's out of phase,
	and really all the robot needs to do is have two opposite regular sin waves going at the same time
	so it'll be way easier to learn if there's no phase change between runs
